# Leggiamo Redux

A polishing of the wonderful Italian learning resource, Leggiamo! created by Andrea Petri. Original found here: https://leggiamoitaliano.weebly.com/this-project.html

I created this project to fix typos and formatting issues in the text, as well as to separate out the English translations from the text as footnotes. This will make the text more readable, allow for review and testing of vocabulary, and provide the option to export the text as an epub for use with various e-readers.
